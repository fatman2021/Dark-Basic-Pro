This program is designed to create custom block transitions for use with the DB2DWipes.DLL sceen transition library. Source code is provided (in Delphi 6 format) should you want to extend the functionality of TMaker.

See the demo program written in DarkBASIC for use of the custom block data exported from TMaker.

Notes:

A complete screen transition uses all 768 blocks (32 wide by 24 tall) - although you can load and save incomplete transitions with TMaker, you will not be able to export DarkBASIC data files for use with the DLL unless all blocks are assigned.

You may use the SpaceBar when editing to toggle the block layer mode - Adding blocks, removing blocks, and skipping blocks. 

There are utility buttons that allow you to fill, clear, or fill in a single line to the border in all 8 standard linear directions.

You may also use the Play button to see how your transition looks over time.
