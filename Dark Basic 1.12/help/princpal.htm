The purpose of this section of the help is to teach you how to write your own DARK BASIC programs. BASIC is an acronym for Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. DARK derives from the term 'Dark Horse' (go ahead, look it up). The traditional description of a program is a task that you want your computer to perform. The task is described to the computer using statements DARK BASIC can understand.<br>
<br>
Statements in your program must be written using a set of rules known as 'Syntax'. You must follow these rules if you are to write DARK BASIC programs. By proceeding through these sections in sequence, you will gain a firm understanding about the general rules of BASIC and how to apply them as a programmer.<br>
