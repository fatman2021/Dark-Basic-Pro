For our very first program, we want to get something happening as soon as possible. We will write a program that prints "hello world" to the screen over and over.<br>
<br>
Step 1 : How to PRINT to the screen<br>
<br>
You can print to the screen using the PRINT command, followed by what it is you wish to print. Lets first print something to the screen by typing the following into the editor:<br>
<br>
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="WHITE" SIZE="4" FACE="Courier">
PRINT "Hello World"<br>
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="WHITE" SIZE="4" FACE="Verdana">
<br>
When you have typed this line into the editor, press F5 to compile and run the program. To go to the editor, click the EDIT button in the top left corner of the screen. When you have finished, you can return to this help page by pressing the F11 Key.<br>
<br>
Step 2 : How to repeat a command over and over<br>
<br>
Now we know how to print something to the screen, the next step is to make our program loop so that the PRINT command is called again and again. Modify your program so that it looks like this:<br>
<br>
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="WHITE" SIZE="4" FACE="Courier">
DO<br>
PRINT "Hello World"<br>
LOOP<br>
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="WHITE" SIZE="4" FACE="Verdana">
<br>
The DO command and LOOP command mark the start and end of the loop for your program. When you run the program, it will continue to run inside this loop forever. You can quit the program at any time by hitting the ESCAPE Key.<br>
<br>
Final Step : Things for you to change<br>
<br>
1. Change the words "Hello World" to anything you want, and see it repeated<br>
2. Place a semi-Colon(;) at the end of the print line to see what happens<br>
3. See the PRINT command help page for more ways to print<br>
