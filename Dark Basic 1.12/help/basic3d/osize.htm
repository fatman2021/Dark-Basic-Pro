This command will return a real number representing of the full unit size of the specified 3D object. The unit size can be used to determine whether or not to scale the object for better visibility. Extremely small and extremely large objects will both suffer visual clipping when viewed by the camera. As a rule, your objects should have a unit size of between 50 and 3000. The finite visibility of the camera has a range of 5000 units, and objects of a distance greater than this will be clipped. Objects that are so close to the camera that they pass behind the camera will also be clipped. The parameter should be specified using an integer value.<BR><BR>
