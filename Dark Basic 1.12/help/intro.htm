Welcome to the Dark Basic programming language, the most powerful BASIC language on the planet. Dark Basic requires no knowledge of programming, operating systems, previous creativity tools or utilities. All that is required from you is a good imagination and the desire to create your own software. The rest you can learn.<br>
<br>
Dark Basic allows you to create anything from a simple text program to a fast full screen 3D game. A single command can give you access to sound, music, animation, text and graphics with incredible ease. You can read and control peripheral devices such as force feedback joysticks and head mounted displays. The only thing between you and the creation of commercial quality software is time and talent.<br>
<br>
There are two schools of learning open to you. You may choose an academic route that details the various aspects of the BASIC language and prepares a foundation on which you can build. Alternatively, you may opt for the fast track that gives you a taste of programming in less than 15 minutes.<br>
