PERFORM CHECKLIST FOR NET PLAYERS

<BR><FONT COLOR="White"><FONT SIZE="4">
This command will fill the checklist with all the players currently seen by the currently active net game. The checklist contains five pieces of data for each player listed. The checklist string contains the given name of the player. The checklist value A contains a Unique ID provided for the player when the player appeared in the net gane. This ID is only unique to the application and will remain with the player as long as it resides in the net game. You can use this ID to reference an array containing the players game data. The checklist value B contains a special universal ID for the player, and this value does not change from machine to machine. You can use it to isolate a player on any machine. Checklist Value C will be set to one if the listed player is the current local player. Checklist Value D will be set to one if the listed player is the host player of the net game.
