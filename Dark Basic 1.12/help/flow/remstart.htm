This command allows you to document large areas of your program. The REMSTART and REMEND commands define an area of your program that will be ignored by the compiler. You can use remarks to provide a better description of what your program is doing. You will find it good practice to make remarks often, as you will gradually forget what each part of your program does as time goes by. Another use of REMSTART and REMEND is to temporarily remove command sequences from your program without having to delete them. By placing these commands around the offending commands, the compiler will ignore them and will be skipped when the program is run.<BR><BR>
