PERFORM CHECKLIST FOR NET CONNECTIONS

<BR><FONT COLOR="White"><FONT SIZE="4">
This command will fill the checklist with the names of all the currently available connections on the machine. There are usually four types of connections available to you including TCP/IP, IPX, Modem and Serial. TCP/IP is used to connect via an IP Address and is used for Internet games. IPX is used for playing net games over a Local Area Network (LAN). A Modem connection is a two player net game with a Dial player and a Receive player, played over a phone line. A Serial connection is a direct cable connecting two machines, and acts much like a Modem connection. The index of the checklist is also the connection number associated with the connection description obtained from this command.
