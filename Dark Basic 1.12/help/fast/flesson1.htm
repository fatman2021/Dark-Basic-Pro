You will already have noticed a number of buttons on the screen. Two large yellow buttons in the top right and a few smaller text buttons in the top left. This is as complicated as the Dark Basic editor gets.<br>
<br>
In order to execute a command on its own, you can make use of the Command Line Interface, or CLI for short. You can use the CLI to try out commands without having to write a program first.<br>
<br>
You will shortly be entering the CLI. When you are there, type the following:<br>
<br>

<FONT COLOR="YELLOW" SIZE="4" FACE="Courier">
PRINT "Hello World"<br>
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="WHITE" SIZE="4" FACE="Verdana">
<br>
When you have typed out this line, hit the RETURN key. The RETURN key is used to execute the command line. The command itself prints 'Hello World' to the screen. You can enter the CLI by clicking the CLI button located at the top of the screen. You can then return to the help page by clicking the EXIT button located on the CLI bar.<br>
