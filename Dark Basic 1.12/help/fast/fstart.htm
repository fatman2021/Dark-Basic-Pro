You want to create something now and learn the academics later on. The fast track will skip large chunks of ground work to get you using Dark Basic as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
The fast track will let you accomplish five things:<br>
<br>
1) <a href="flesson1.htm">Execute your first command</a><br>
2) <a href="flesson2.htm">Create your first program</a><br>
3) <a href="flesson3.htm">Create your much better second program</a><br>
4) <a href="flesson4.htm">Build your first standalone executable</a><br>
5) <a href="flesson5.htm">Find and run your standalone executable</a><br>
<br>
You will be instructed what to do at every stage. You will be required to leave the help system from time to time, but you can always return using the F11 key. If you have misunderstood a lesson and need to return to an earlier stage, the BACK button at the top of the screen will step back through the pages.<br>
<br>
Select <a href="flesson1.htm">LESSON ONE</a> to learn how to execute your first command or select <a href="..\menu.htm">MAIN MENU</a> to return to the main menu.
