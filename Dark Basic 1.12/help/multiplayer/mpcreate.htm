CREATE NET GAME

<BR><FONT COLOR="White"><FONT SIZE="4">
This command will create a multiplayer net game. The Gamename describes the name of the game and will be the name of the session when the game begins. The Playername is the name you wish to give the initial host of the game. The number of players can be between 2 and 256, and sets the maximum number of players that can join the net game. You can optionally specify a flag which controls the type of net game created. A value of 1 is the default and specifies a Pier to Pier game, where a value of 2 specifies a Client/Server game. A Pier to Pier game has every computer communicate with each other. A Client/Server game has all player traffic routed through the host computer and then broadcasted to the rest of the players.

You will need to set a connection before you can create a net game, however this command will automatically select the first connection it finds if you have selected one.
