So what exactly are media files? Media is another word to describe the graphics, models, sounds, music and animation you will include in your programs. Media files are a critical ingredient to the presentation of your software.<br>
<br>
Dark Basic is able to load five different types of media. Bitmap Files (BMP) can be loaded using LOAD BITMAP and store graphic images in the most common PC format. Sound Files (WAV) can be loaded using LOAD SOUND and store wave pattern data used to reproduce sound effects. Midi Files (MID) can be loaded using LOAD MUSIC and store extremely compact music scores. Animation Files (AVI) can be loaded using LOAD ANIMATION and store compressed video and audio information for real video playback. Model Files (X) can be loaded using LOAD OBJECT and store 3D model data in the Direct X file format.<br>
<br>
Media files are created using specialised editors. You can link Dark Basic to a media editor by selecting the 'Specify An Editor' item from the Media Menu.<br>

FOR EXAMPLE: Select 'Specify An Editor' from the media menu to enter the media editors dialogue. Click the 'Browse' button corresponding to the WAV entry box. Navigate to your Windows directory and find SNDREC32.EXE and click the file twice. Now close the media editors dialogue and re-select the media menu. Select the newly highlighted Sound Editor item to launch the chosen media editor.<br>
