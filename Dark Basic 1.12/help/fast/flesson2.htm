To create a program, you must write a sequence of commands in the editor. You can get to the editor from here very easily using the F11 key. You can return from the editor to the help page by pressing the F11 key again. You can use this key to bounce from editor to help, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
Go to the editor and type the following program:<br>
<br>

DO<br>
PRINT "Hello Again"<br>
LOOP<br>
</FONT>

<br>
You will shortly be running your program, but you must then be able to exit your program and return to the editor. At any time during the running of your program, you can press the F12 key to break from your program and return to the editor.<br>
<br>
From the editor, press the F5 key to compile and run your program. After a few second, press F12 to return to the editor. Alternatively, you can press F11 to return here.<br>
<br>
After you have created and run your program, select <a href="flesson3.htm">LESSON THREE</a> to continue.
