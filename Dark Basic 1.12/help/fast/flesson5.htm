For the most part, this means leaving the Dark Basic environment. If you are dealing with the world outside Dark Basic, it is important to know how to find and manage your executable files. How else will you be able to show off your programs?<br>
<br>
You will shortly be asked to exit Dark Basic to locate and find the executable you have built. The search should not be too difficult if you have remembered the name of your executable. All executable files are recognized by their .EXE extension. Dark Basic automatically appends this extension if not part of your filename.<br>
<br>
If you remember where you installed Dark Basic, you should find your executable file located in the DARK BASIC SOFTWARE\DARK BASIC\HELP\FAST\CAVERUN directory. Alternatively, you can go to START -> FIND -> FILES OR FOLDERS.. and enter the name of your executable. When you have located your executable, you can run it as normal. Either double click the file or use the right mouse button on the file and select Open. You can exit the program using the ESCAPE key. This completes your 15 minute lesson.<br>
<br>
To exit Dark Basic, simply click the EXIT button in the top right corner of the screen.<br>
