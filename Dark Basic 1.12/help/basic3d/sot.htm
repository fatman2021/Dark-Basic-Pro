This command will set different texture modes used by the specified object. Every texture is painted onto an object using an internal set of values called UV data. This data contains a range of real numbers from zero to one. Zero specifying the top/left corner of your texture and one being the bottom/right corner of your texture. When an object uses UV data greater and less than this range, you are permitted a number of texture wrap modes to describe what should happen to paint these areas. Setting the Texture Wrap Mode to zero will use the default wrap mode which repeat the pattern of the texture over and over, a mode of one will mirror the texture to create a seamless texture pattern and a mode of two will set clamping which retains the colour of the last pixel at the textures edge and paint with that throughout the out of range area. The Mipmap Generation Flag is used to generate mipmap textures for objects that do not have a mipmap. A mipmap is a texture that has many levels of detail, which the object can select and use based on the objects distance from the camera. Setting this flag to one will generate a mipmap for the specified object. Use integer values to specify the parameters.<BR><BR>
