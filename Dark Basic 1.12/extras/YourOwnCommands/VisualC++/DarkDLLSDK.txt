'Quick View Pro' was used to extract this data from the DLL:

Ordinal	Entry Point	Name
0000	000010b1	?FunctionReturnFloat@@YAKM@Z
0001	00001066	?FunctionReturnInteger@@YAKH@Z
0002	00001101	?FunctionReturnString@@YAKPAD@Z
0003	0000104d	?SimpleFunction@@YAXXZ

The name part is the decorated names of the Functions the
DarkDLLSDK.DLL File exports and which you can call within
your DarkBASIC Program. You must also ensure you use the
right number and type of parameters or the call will fail.
