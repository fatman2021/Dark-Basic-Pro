The camera acts as the eye through which you see your 3D world. The camera can be angled in any direction, pointed towards any location and placed anywhere in your scene with a single command. This provides the power to create whatever game perspective you want; 1st person, birds-eye, isometric, ground up or free-floating.<br>
